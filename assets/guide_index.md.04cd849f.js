Alba <em>scenarios</em> actually exercise the full ASP.Net Core application by running HTTP requests through your ASP.NET system <strong>in memory</strong> using the built in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests?view=aspnetcore-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASP.Net Core TestServer</a>.</p><p>You can certainly write integration tests by hand using the lower level <code>TestServer</code> and <code>HttpClient</code>, but you&#39;ll write much less code with Alba to author integration tests against your ASP.Net Core web services. Moreover, Alba <em>scenarios</em> were meant to be declarative to maximize the readability of the integration tests, making those tests much more valuable as living technical documentation.</p><h2 id="history" tabindex="-1">History <a class="header-anchor" href="#history" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>What is now Alba was originally created in the early 2010&#39;s as a mechanism to test the content negotiation features in <a href="https://fubumvc.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FubuMVC</a>, an alternative web application framework that predates ASP.Net Core. We needed to run the entire web handling stack including all the middleware and HTTP endpoints just as the application would be configured. The <a href="https://jeremydmiller.com/2015/11/05/testing-http-handlers-with-no-web-server-in-sight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early <em>scenario</em> support in FubuMVC</a> was a way to run HTTP requests end to end completely in memory and make declarative checks on expected HTTP behavior.</p><p>As FubuMVC wound down as a project, the scenario testing code was first extracted out into its own library called <em>Alba</em>, then ported to depend on an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/owin?view=aspnetcore-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OWIN-based</a> execution pipeline. And then again with the advent of ASP.Net Core and the deprecation of OWIN, Alba was again re-wired to use the newer HTTP abstractions from the ASP.Net Core <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httpcontext?view=aspnetcore-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HttpContext</a> type. At this point, Alba is a value added wrapper around the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests?view=aspnetcore-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASP.Net Core TestServer</a>.</p><p>The <em>scenario</em> testing in Alba was inspired by the <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/ScalaFunctionalTestingWithSpecs2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing support in the Scala PlayFramework</a>.</p>',9),s=[n];function i(l,c,h,d,p,u){return a(),t("div",null,s)}var g=e(o,[["render",i]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
