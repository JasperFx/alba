We needed to run the entire web handling stack including all the middleware and HTTP endpoints just as the application would be configured. The <a href="https://jeremydmiller.com/2015/11/05/testing-http-handlers-with-no-web-server-in-sight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">early <em>scenario</em> support in FubuMVC</a> was a way to run HTTP requests end to end completely in memory and make declarative checks on expected HTTP behavior.</p><p>As FubuMVC wound down as a project, the scenario testing code was first extracted out into its own library called <em>Alba</em>, then ported to depend on an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/owin?view=aspnetcore-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OWIN-based</a> execution pipeline. And then again with the advent of ASP.NET Core and the deprecation of OWIN, Alba was again re-wired to use the newer HTTP abstractions from the ASP.NET Core <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httpcontext?view=aspnetcore-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HttpContext</a> type. At this point, Alba is a value added wrapper around the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests?view=aspnetcore-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ASP.NET Core TestServer</a>.</p><p>The <em>scenario</em> testing in Alba was inspired by the <a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/ScalaFunctionalTestingWithSpecs2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">testing support in the Scala PlayFramework</a>.</p><p>When using Alba, you actually bootstrap your web application in memory using either the &quot;older&quot; <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.hostbuilder?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HostBuilder model</a> or the newer <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.testing.webapplicationfactory-1?view=aspnetcore-6.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WebApplicationFactory</a> model , then pass the root <code>IHost</code> of the running application to Alba&#39;s <code>AlbaHost</code>, which will be the entry point to using Alba in all of your integration tests.</p><p><code>AlbaHost</code> is shown in the class diagram below:</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="AlbaHost Class Diagram"></p><p><code>AlbaHost</code> implements the ASP.NET Core <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.hosting.ihost?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IHost</a> interface for convenience and familiarity. Internally it is tracking the actual <code>IHost</code> for your application running in memory as well as an instance of the ASP.NET Core <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests?view=aspnetcore-6.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TestServer</a> that will actually be used to execute HTTP requests against the application in memory.</p>',8),i=[s];function c(l,p,h,d,m,u){return a(),t("div",null,i)}const g=e(n,[["render",c]]);export{b as __pageData,g as default};
