# Writing Scenarios

::: tip
Alba executes requests through your application without any knowledge of the middleware,
controllers, or the other mechanisms that may be handling the request in your application.
:::

For the purpose of this sample, let's say you have a very simple web service application with the following controller endpoint:


<!-- snippet: sample_MathController -->
<a id='snippet-sample_mathcontroller'></a>
```cs
public enum OperationType
{
    Add,
    Subtract,
    Multiply,
    Divide
}

public class OperationRequest
{
    public OperationType Type { get; set; }
    public int One { get; set; }
    public int Two { get; set; }
}

public class OperationResult
{
    public int Answer { get; set; }
    public string Method { get; set; }
}

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class MathController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet("add/{one}/{two}")]
    public OperationResult Add(int one, int two)
    {
        return new OperationResult
        {
            Answer = one + two
        };
    }

    [HttpPut]
    public OperationResult Put([FromBody]OperationRequest request)
    {
        switch (request.Type)
        {
            case OperationType.Add:
                return new OperationResult{Answer = request.One + request.Two, Method = "PUT"};
            
            case OperationType.Multiply:
                return new OperationResult{Answer = request.One * request.Two, Method = "PUT"};
            
            case OperationType.Subtract:
                return new OperationResult{Answer = request.One - request.Two, Method = "PUT"};
            
            default:
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(request.Type));
        }
    }
    
    [HttpPost]
    public OperationResult Post([FromBody]OperationRequest request)
    {
        switch (request.Type)
        {
            case OperationType.Add:
                return new OperationResult{Answer = request.One + request.Two, Method = "POST"};
                
            case OperationType.Multiply:
                return new OperationResult{Answer = request.One * request.Two, Method = "POST"};
            
            case OperationType.Subtract:
                return new OperationResult{Answer = request.One - request.Two, Method = "POST"};
            
            default:
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(request.Type));
        }
    }
```

<!-- endSnippet -->

Back in your test project, the easiest, and probably most common, usage of Alba is to send and verify JSON message bodies to `Controller` actions. To that end,
let's test the GET method in that controller above by passing a url and verifying the results:

<!-- snippet: sample_get_json -->
<a id='snippet-sample_get_json'></a>
```cs
[Fact]
public async Task get_happy_path()
{
    await using var system = await AlbaHost.For<WebApp.Program>();
    
    // Issue a request, and check the results
    var result = await system.GetAsJson<OperationResult>("/math/add/3/4");
        
    result.Answer.ShouldBe(7);
}
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/alba/blob/master/src/Alba.Testing/using_json_helpers.cs#L14-L25' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_get_json' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

So what just happened in that test? First off, the call to `new AlbaHost(IHostBuilder)` bootstraps your web application.

The call to `host.GetAsJson<OperationResult>("/math/add/3/4")` is performing these steps internally:

1. Formulate an [HttpRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httprequest?view=aspnetcore-5.0) object that will be passed to the application
1. Executes the web request against your application
1. Assert in this simple use case that the response status code is `200 OK`
1. Read the raw JSON coming off the [HttpResponse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.http.httpresponse?view=aspnetcore-5.0)
1. Deserialize the raw JSON to the requested `OperationResult` type using the Json formatter of the running application
1. Returns the resulting `OperationResult`

Alright then, let's try posting JSON in and examining the JSON out:

<!-- snippet: sample_post_json_get_json -->
<a id='snippet-sample_post_json_get_json'></a>
```cs
[Fact]
public async Task post_and_expect_response()
{
    await using var system = await AlbaHost.For<WebApp.Program>();
    var request = new OperationRequest
    {
        Type = OperationType.Multiply,
        One = 3,
        Two = 4
    };

    var result = await system.PostJson(request, "/math")
        .Receive<OperationResult>();
        
    result.Answer.ShouldBe(12);
    result.Method.ShouldBe("POST");
}
```
<sup><a href='https://github.com/JasperFx/alba/blob/master/src/Alba.Testing/using_json_helpers.cs#L27-L45' title='Snippet source file'>snippet source</a> | <a href='#snippet-sample_post_json_get_json' title='Start of snippet'>anchor</a></sup>
<!-- endSnippet -->

It's a little more complicated, but the same goal is realized here. Allow the test author to work in terms of the application model objects while still exercising the entire HTTP middleware stack.

Don't stop here though, Alba also gives you the ability to declaratively assert on elements of the `HttpResponse` like expected header values, status codes, and assertions against the response body. In addition, Alba provides a lot of helper facilities to work with the raw `HttpResponse` data.

::: tip
The scenario support is not hard coded to use Newtonsoft.Json for Json serialization and will instead use the configured
Json formatters within your application. Long story short, Alba now supports applications using System.Text.Json as well as Newtonsoft.Json.
